Steps followed to create the project:

create package.json file

go to the root folder and run the command

```npm init```

run the command to install protractor locally

```npm install protractor```
note: latest protractor version should have added to the dependencies in the package.json file by now.

define the other dependencies needed for the project in the 'package.json' file

ref: https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/exampleTypescript/package.json

run the command ```npm install``` to fetch all the dependencies to the node-modules folder

Next step: after introducing page objects and the project run independently. 
Instead of accessing protractor installed globaly in the local env, after following the below steps, the project will use protractor installed locally in the node_modules

Add the following to the package.json

 "scripts": {
    "test": "protractor JSFiles/config.js",
    "pretest": "tsc",
    "protractor": "./node_modules/protractor/built/cli.js",
    "webdriver-update": "./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update"
  }

  Commands to run

  ``` npm run webdriver-update```
  ```npm run test```

  Extend the framework to use cucumber 
      ref: https://github.com/protractor-cucumber-framework/protractor-cucumber-framework

      create the cucumber-config.ts file
      Add dependencies to the package.json file

        
      change 1 ( add  "cucumbertest": "protractor JSFiles/cucumber-config.js", to the scripts object)

      ```
      "scripts": {
        "test": "protractor JSFiles/config.js",
        "pretest": "tsc",
        "cucumbertest": "protractor JSFiles/cucumber-config.js",
        "protractor": "./node_modules/protractor/built/cli.js",
        "webdriver-update": "./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update"
      },
      ```

      change 2 (following dependencies are to be fetched to the node-modules folder)
      ```
      "protractor-cucumber-framework": "^6.2.1",
        "cucumber": "^6.0.5",
        "@types/cucumber": "4.0.4",
        "chai": "^4.2.0",
        "chai-as-promised": "^7.1.1"
      ```

  After the above changes to the script object in package.json ,
  need to run cucumber feature files as: 
  
  ```tsc``` //to compile typescript files to .js files
  ```npm run cucumbertest```
  
  Else, 
  
  we will have to replace the script to be as below, 
  ```
   "scripts": {
        "test": "protractor JSFiles/cucumber-config.js",

  ```
  And then no need of running ```tsc``` command before ```npm run test```
  pretest and test are identified as standard commands to node.


  Adopt chai assertion library to use with Cucumber, add it as a dependency to package.json.
